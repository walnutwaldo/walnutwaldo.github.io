          <li><p><h6>Biography:</h6>As of the time that I am writing this (June 2020), I am a 17 year old guy who just graduated high school and will be attending Harvard College in Cambridge, MA in the fall (if coronavirus allows).
              In high school, I participated in many clubs and extracurriculars, including Varsity Tenis, Student Government (Treasurer), Investment Club (Founder), and LEO.
              I also run local programming classes at my local library and did computer science research with MIT PRIMES for two and a half years.
              In my free time I enjoy programming and solving math problems. In particular, I participated in USACO and will be representing the USA at IOI 2020.
              I also took part in the AMC and AIME but unfortunately, I am not as good as those people who were able to make it to USAMO.
              Some other passions of mine are reading (currently reading Walden), playing tennis, and working out.</p></li>
